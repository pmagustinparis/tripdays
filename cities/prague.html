        <h2>Why Visit Prague?</h2>
        <p>
          Prague, the "City of a Hundred Spires," captivates visitors with its
          fairy-tale atmosphere, where Gothic, Baroque, Renaissance, and Art
          Nouveau buildings create one of Europe's most beautiful urban
          landscapes. The Czech capital's historic center, a UNESCO World
          Heritage site, has miraculously survived wars and revolutions with its
          medieval layout and ancient architecture largely intact. Straddling
          the Vltava River, Prague offers a perfect blend of history and
          modernity, where you can cross the 14th-century Charles Bridge in the
          morning, explore the largest ancient castle complex in the world by
          afternoon, and enjoy world-class jazz in a contemporary venue by
          night. The city delights with its hidden courtyards, winding
          cobblestone streets, and unexpected vistas that reveal themselves
          around every corner. Beyond its architectural splendor, Prague boasts
          a rich cultural heritage, from classical music to puppet theaters, and
          a renowned beer culture with some of the world's finest brews. With
          its central European location, reasonable prices, and welcoming
          atmosphere, Prague provides an enchanting experience that combines
          old-world charm with vibrant contemporary life.

        <h2>How Many Days Do You Need in Prague?</h2>
        <p>
          To properly experience Prague, we recommend <strong>3-5 days</strong>.
          This duration allows you to visit the major attractions, explore
          different neighborhoods, enjoy the food and beer scene, and perhaps
          take a day trip to nearby destinations like Kutná Hora or Karlštejn
          Castle. If you only have 1-2 days, you can still see the highlights,
          but you'll need to be selective and focus on specific areas. With more
          than 5 days, you can discover Prague at a more relaxed pace and
          venture further afield to places like Český Krumlov, Karlovy Vary, or
          even neighboring cities like Vienna or Dresden.

        <h2>Prague Itinerary: Day by Day</h2>

        <div class="day-plan">
          <h3>Day 1: Prague Castle and Lesser Town</h3>
          <div class="day-content">
            <p>
              Begin your Prague adventure with its most iconic landmark. Start
              at <strong>Prague Castle</strong> (Pražský hrad), the largest
              ancient castle complex in the world and the official residence of
              the Czech president. Arrive early to avoid crowds and witness the
              Changing of the Guard ceremony at noon. Explore the castle
              grounds, including the magnificent
              <strong>St. Vitus Cathedral</strong> with its stunning stained
              glass windows, the <strong>Old Royal Palace</strong>,
              <strong>St. George's Basilica</strong>, and the charming
              <strong>Golden Lane</strong> with its tiny, colorful houses. After
              lunch, descend into the picturesque
              <strong>Lesser Town</strong> (Malá Strana) with its Baroque
              palaces and churches. Visit the beautiful
              <strong>St. Nicholas Church</strong> with its impressive dome and
              bell tower. Stroll through
              <strong>Wallenstein Garden</strong> with its geometric layout and
              peculiar statues. End your day by walking across the iconic
              <strong>Charles Bridge</strong> (Karlův most) with its 30 statues
              of saints, enjoying the sunset views of the Vltava River and
              Prague Castle.

        <div class="day-plan">
          <h3>Day 2: Old Town and Jewish Quarter</h3>
          <div class="day-content">
            <p>
              Dedicate this day to Prague's historic center. Begin at the
              <strong>Old Town Square</strong> (Staroměstské náměstí), one of
              Europe's most beautiful urban spaces, surrounded by colorful
              historic buildings. Watch the
              <strong>Astronomical Clock</strong> (Orloj) strike the hour with
              its procession of apostles (on the hour from 9 AM to 11 PM). Visit
              the Gothic <strong>Church of Our Lady before Týn</strong> with its
              distinctive twin spires and the <strong>Old Town Hall</strong>.
              Continue to the <strong>Jewish Quarter</strong> (Josefov) to
              explore its synagogues and the hauntingly beautiful
              <strong>Old Jewish Cemetery</strong> with graves layered up to 12
              deep due to space limitations. Visit the
              <strong>Spanish Synagogue</strong> with its stunning Moorish
              interior and the <strong>Old-New Synagogue</strong>, Europe's
              oldest active synagogue. In the afternoon, walk along
              <strong>Paris Street</strong> (Pařížská), Prague's most exclusive
              shopping avenue. End your day with a traditional Czech dinner in
              one of the Old Town's historic restaurants, perhaps trying
              classics like goulash, svíčková (marinated beef), or roast duck
              with dumplings and sauerkraut.

        <div class="day-plan">
          <h3>Day 3: New Town and Vyšehrad</h3>
          <div class="day-content">
            <p>
              Explore Prague beyond the medieval center. Begin at
              <strong>Wenceslas Square</strong> (Václavské náměstí), the
              commercial heart of Prague and site of many historic events,
              including the Velvet Revolution. Visit the
              <strong>National Museum</strong> at the top of the square or the
              <strong>Museum of Communism</strong> to learn about the city's
              recent history. Continue to the <strong>New Town</strong> (Nové
              Město), which despite its name dates back to the 14th century. See
              the unusual <strong>Dancing House</strong> (Tančící dům), a modern
              building resembling a pair of dancers. In the afternoon, visit
              <strong>Vyšehrad</strong>, a historic fort on a hill overlooking
              the Vltava River, with beautiful gardens, the neo-Gothic
              <strong>Church of St. Peter and Paul</strong>, and a cemetery
              where many famous Czech personalities are buried. Enjoy panoramic
              views of Prague from the ramparts. End your day with a sunset
              river cruise on the Vltava, seeing Prague's illuminated landmarks
              from a different perspective.

        <div class="day-plan">
          <h3>Day 4: Day Trip to Kutná Hora</h3>
          <div class="day-content">
            <p>
              Take a day trip to <strong>Kutná Hora</strong>, a UNESCO World
              Heritage site about an hour east of Prague by train. This medieval
              silver mining town was once the second most important city in the
              Bohemian Kingdom. Visit the magnificent
              <strong>St. Barbara's Church</strong>, a Gothic masterpiece built
              by the wealthy miners. Explore the
              <strong>Italian Court</strong> (Vlašský dvůr), a former royal
              residence and mint where the Prague groschen coins were once
              produced. The town's most unusual attraction is the
              <strong>Sedlec Ossuary</strong> (Bone Church), a small chapel
              decorated with the bones of an estimated 40,000-70,000 people,
              arranged into chandeliers, coats of arms, and other decorations.
              Return to Prague in the evening and experience the city's beer
              culture by visiting a traditional Czech beer hall like
              <strong>U Fleků</strong>, brewing beer since 1499, or one of the
              modern craft beer establishments that have flourished in recent
              years.

          <div class="day-content">
            <p>
              On your final day, discover Prague's artistic and alternative
              side. Begin at <strong>Prague's National Gallery</strong> in the
              Veletržní Palace, housing an impressive collection of modern and
              contemporary art, including works by Picasso, Monet, and Czech
              artists like Mucha and Kupka. Visit the
              <strong>DOX Centre for Contemporary Art</strong> in the Holešovice
              district, a converted factory that hosts innovative exhibitions.
              Explore the vibrant <strong>Holešovice</strong> neighborhood, once
              an industrial area now transformed with galleries, design shops,
              and cafes. See the <strong>John Lennon Wall</strong>, filled with
              Beatles-inspired graffiti and messages of peace since the 1980s.
              Visit <strong>Kampa Island</strong> and the
              <strong>Museum Kampa</strong> with its collection of Central
              European modern art. End your Prague adventure by exploring the
              trendy <strong>Žižkov</strong> or
              <strong>Vinohrady</strong> neighborhoods, known for their local
              atmosphere, numerous pubs, and restaurants away from the tourist
              crowds. Enjoy a farewell dinner at a local restaurant, perhaps
              accompanied by Czech beer or wine from the Moravian region.

        <h2>Practical Tips for Visiting Prague</h2>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
          <p>
            The best times to visit Prague are during
            <strong>spring (April to May)</strong> and
            <strong>fall (September to October)</strong> when the weather is
            mild and crowds are smaller. Summer (June to August) brings warm
            temperatures but also the largest crowds and higher prices. Winter
            (November to March) can be cold with occasional snow, but offers
            magical Christmas markets in December and generally lower prices.
            Prague is particularly beautiful when dusted with snow, though some
            attractions may have reduced hours. Major events include the Prague
            Spring Music Festival (May-June), Christmas Markets (December), and
            the Bohemian Carnival (February).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <p>
            Prague has an excellent public transportation system. The
            <strong>metro</strong>, <strong>trams</strong>, and
            <strong>buses</strong> are efficient, affordable, and reach all
            parts of the city. Purchase a 24-hour, 72-hour, or weekly pass for
            unlimited travel. The historic center is compact and best explored
            on foot, though be prepared for cobblestone streets and comfortable
            walking shoes are essential. Taxis are available but use only
            official companies or ride-hailing apps like Uber or Bolt to avoid
            overcharging. Prague is built on hills, so be prepared for some
            uphill walking, particularly around Prague Castle and Vyšehrad.
            River cruises offer a relaxing way to see the city from a different
            perspective.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Budget Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Prague is more affordable than many Western European capitals.
            Expect to spend about
            <strong>1500-2500 CZK ($60-100) per day</strong> per person for
            mid-range travel, including accommodation, meals, attractions, and
            transportation. Save money by eating at local restaurants away from
            tourist areas, using public transportation, and taking advantage of
            free attractions like parks, churches (when not during services),
            and walking tours. Budget accommodations start around 500-1000 CZK
            ($20-40) per night, while mid-range hotels range from 1500-3000 CZK
            ($60-120). The <strong>Prague Card</strong> offers free entry to
            many attractions and unlimited public transport, which may be
            worthwhile if you plan to visit multiple paid sites.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Local Etiquette</h3>
          <p>
            Czechs are generally reserved but friendly. Greet people with a
            simple "Dobrý den" (Good day) when entering small shops or
            restaurants. Tipping is customary in restaurants - 10% is standard
            for good service, though not obligatory as in the US. Round up the
            bill for taxis and small purchases. When visiting churches, dress
            modestly and maintain a respectful silence. Remove your hat when
            entering buildings. Czechs are proud of their beer culture - when
            toasting, maintain eye contact, say "Na zdraví" (To health), and
            never cross arms with others while clinking glasses. Be aware that
            many restaurants and cafes in tourist areas may add a service charge
            - check your bill carefully.
          </p>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Is Prague Worth Visiting?</h2>
        <p>
          Prague is absolutely worth visiting for its extraordinary preservation
          of historical architecture, rich cultural heritage, and atmospheric
          charm. Few European cities offer such a complete medieval urban
          landscape, where you can walk across a 14th-century bridge, explore a
          thousand-year-old castle, and dine in Gothic cellars all in one day.
          The city's reasonable prices compared to Western European capitals
          make it accessible for travelers on various budgets. While Prague can
          be crowded in the summer months, its many hidden courtyards,
          lesser-known neighborhoods, and quiet early mornings offer
          opportunities to experience the city's magic away from the tourist
          throngs. Whether you're interested in history, architecture, music,
          art, or simply soaking up the ambiance of one of Europe's most
          beautiful cities, Prague offers an enchanting experience that
          continues to captivate visitors from around the world.
