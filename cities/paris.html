        <h2>How Many Days Do You Need in Paris?</h2>
        <p>
          To truly experience Paris, we recommend <strong>5-7 days</strong>.
          This duration allows you to visit the major attractions without
          rushing, explore different neighborhoods, enjoy the cuisine, and even
          take a day trip to nearby Versailles. If you only have 3-4 days, you
          can still see the highlights, but you'll need to prioritize. With a
          week or more, you can immerse yourself in the Parisian lifestyle and
          discover hidden gems beyond the tourist circuit.

        <h2>Practical Tips for Visiting Paris</h2>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
          <p>
            The ideal times to visit Paris are <strong>April to June</strong> or
            <strong>September to October</strong> when the weather is pleasant
            and crowds are smaller. Summer (July-August) is peak tourist season
            with longer lines and higher prices, while many locals are away on
            vacation. Winter offers fewer crowds and festive decorations, but
            shorter days and cooler temperatures.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <p>
            Paris has an excellent public transportation system. The
            <strong>Metro</strong> is the fastest way to get around, with
            stations near most attractions. Consider purchasing a
            <strong>Paris Visite pass</strong> for unlimited travel. Walking is
            ideal for exploring neighborhoods, while
            <strong>Vélib'</strong> bike rentals offer another pleasant option
            in good weather. Taxis and rideshares are available but traffic can
            be heavy.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Budget Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Expect to spend about <strong>€100-150 per day</strong> per person
            for mid-range travel, including accommodation, meals, attractions,
            and transportation. Save money by visiting museums on the first
            Sunday of the month (free admission), purchasing the
            <strong>Paris Museum Pass</strong> for multiple attractions, and
            enjoying picnics in parks with food from local markets. Budget
            accommodations start around €80 per night, while mid-range hotels
            range from €120-200.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Local Etiquette</h3>
          <p>
            Always greet shop owners and restaurant staff with
            "<strong>Bonjour</strong>" (hello) or "<strong>Bonsoir</strong>"
            (good evening) when entering. Learn a few basic French phrases -
            locals appreciate the effort. Tipping is not required as service is
            included in restaurant bills, but rounding up or leaving a few euros
            for good service is appreciated.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Is Paris Worth Visiting?</h2>
        <p>
          Paris lives up to its reputation as one of the world's most beautiful
          and culturally rich cities. With its blend of iconic landmarks,
          world-class museums, charming neighborhoods, and exceptional cuisine,
          Paris offers something for every traveler. While 5-7 days allows for a
          comprehensive experience, even a shorter visit will leave you with
          unforgettable memories and likely a desire to return.
