        <h2>Why Visit London?</h2>
        <p>
          London, one of the world's most visited cities, offers an incredible
          blend of history, culture, and modernity. This dynamic metropolis
          boasts iconic landmarks that span centuries, from the medieval Tower
          of London to the contemporary Shard skyscraper. With its world-class
          museums (many offering free admission), diverse neighborhoods, royal
          heritage, and vibrant arts scene, London provides endless
          opportunities for exploration. The city's multicultural population has
          created a culinary paradise with cuisine from around the world, while
          its historic pubs, royal parks, and famous shopping districts add to
          its charm. Whether you're watching the Changing of the Guard at
          Buckingham Palace, exploring the British Museum's treasures, or
          enjoying a West End show, London delivers an unforgettable experience
          that justifies its reputation as a global capital.

        <h2>How Many Days Do You Need in London?</h2>
        <p>
          To properly experience London, we recommend <strong>5-7 days</strong>.
          This duration allows you to visit the major attractions, explore
          different neighborhoods, enjoy the cultural offerings, and perhaps
          take a day trip to nearby destinations like Windsor Castle or Oxford.
          If you only have 3-4 days, you can still see the highlights, but
          you'll need to be selective. With a week or more, you can discover
          London at a more relaxed pace and venture beyond the tourist hotspots.

        <h2>Practical Tips for Visiting London</h2>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
          <p>
            The best times to visit London are <strong>March to May</strong> or
            <strong>September to November</strong> when the weather is mild and
            crowds are smaller. Summer (June-August) brings warmer temperatures
            but larger crowds and higher prices. Winter offers festive
            decorations and January sales, but shorter days and often rainy
            weather.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <p>
            London has an extensive public transportation system. The
            <strong>Underground (Tube)</strong> is the fastest way to travel,
            while buses offer scenic routes. Purchase an
            <strong>Oyster card</strong> or use a contactless payment card for
            the best fares. Consider the <strong>Hopper fare</strong> which
            allows multiple bus journeys within an hour for a single fare.
            Walking is ideal for central areas, and
            <strong>Santander Cycles</strong> offer bike rentals throughout the
            city.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Budget Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Expect to spend about <strong>£120-180 per day</strong> per person
            for mid-range travel, including accommodation, meals, attractions,
            and transportation. Save money by visiting the many free museums,
            purchasing a <strong>London Pass</strong> for multiple paid
            attractions, and using meal deals from supermarkets. Budget
            accommodations start around £80 per night, while mid-range hotels
            range from £120-250.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Local Etiquette</h3>
          <p>
            Stand on the right side of escalators to allow people to pass on the
            left. Queue (line up) for services - Brits take queuing seriously!
            Tipping is customary in restaurants (10-15%) if service isn't
            included, but not necessary in pubs. A simple "please" and "thank
            you" goes a long way in interactions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="conclusion">
        <h2>Is London Worth Visiting?</h2>
        <p>
          London offers an unparalleled mix of history, culture, and modernity
          that few cities can match. With its world-class (and often free)
          museums, iconic landmarks, diverse neighborhoods, and excellent
          transportation system, London provides a wealth of experiences for
          every type of traveler. While 5-7 days gives you a good introduction
          to the city, London's depth means you could spend weeks exploring and
          still discover new treasures.
