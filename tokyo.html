        <h2>Why Visit Tokyo?</h2>
        <p>
          Tokyo, Japan's dynamic capital, is a city of fascinating contrasts
          where ancient traditions harmoniously coexist with cutting-edge
          innovation. This sprawling metropolis offers an unparalleled urban
          experience with its neon-lit skyscrapers, historic temples,
          world-class museums, and peaceful gardens. As a global leader in
          technology, fashion, and pop culture, Tokyo constantly reinvents
          itself while honoring its rich heritage. The city's legendary food
          scene ranges from Michelin-starred restaurants to humble street food
          stalls, all united by an unwavering commitment to quality and
          presentation. Tokyo's distinct neighborhoods each have their own
          character - from the youthful energy of Shibuya and the luxury
          boutiques of Ginza to the traditional atmosphere of Asakusa and the
          otaku paradise of Akihabara. With its efficient public transportation,
          impeccable cleanliness, and the legendary Japanese hospitality, Tokyo
          offers visitors a seamless blend of excitement, culture, and wonder
          that makes it one of the world's most captivating destinations.

        <h2>How Many Days Do You Need in Tokyo?</h2>
        <p>
          To properly experience Tokyo, we recommend <strong>7-10 days</strong>.
          This duration allows you to explore the city's diverse neighborhoods,
          visit major attractions, enjoy the food scene, and perhaps take a day
          trip to nearby destinations like Kamakura or Hakone. If you only have
          4-6 days, you can still see the highlights, but you'll need to be
          selective and focus on specific areas. With more than 10 days, you can
          discover Tokyo at a more relaxed pace and venture further afield to
          places like Nikko or even Kyoto.

        <h2>Practical Tips for Visiting Tokyo</h2>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
          <p>
            The best times to visit Tokyo are
            <strong>late March to early April</strong> for cherry blossoms, and
            <strong>October to November</strong> for autumn colors and pleasant
            weather. Spring and fall offer mild temperatures and beautiful
            seasonal scenery. Summer (June-August) can be hot and humid with
            occasional typhoons, while winter (December-February) is cold but
            relatively dry with fewer tourists. Consider avoiding major Japanese
            holidays like Golden Week (late April to early May) and New Year
            when many businesses close and domestic tourism peaks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Getting Around</h3>
          <p>
            Tokyo has an extensive and efficient public transportation system.
            The <strong>subway and JR trains</strong> connect all parts of the
            city, though the network can be complex for first-time visitors.
            Purchase a <strong>Suica or Pasmo IC card</strong> for convenient
            payment on all trains and buses. Consider a
            <strong>Tokyo Subway Ticket</strong> for unlimited subway rides if
            you'll be using public transport extensively. The
            <strong>Yamanote Line</strong> is particularly useful as it loops
            around central Tokyo, connecting major stations and neighborhoods.
            Taxis are clean and reliable but expensive; use them sparingly.
            Walking is ideal for exploring specific neighborhoods, but distances
            between areas are often too great to walk.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Budget Planning</h3>
          <p>
            Tokyo can be expensive, but there are ways to manage costs. Expect
            to spend about <strong>$100-150 per day</strong> per person for
            mid-range travel, including accommodation, meals, attractions, and
            transportation. Save money by staying in business hotels or hostels,
            eating at casual restaurants like ramen shops and conveyor belt
            sushi, and visiting free attractions like parks and certain temples.
            Budget accommodations start around $50 per night, while mid-range
            hotels range from $100-200. Consider purchasing a
            <strong>Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building</strong> has free
            observation decks with city views comparable to paid towers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-category">
          <h3>Local Etiquette</h3>
          <p>
            Japanese culture values politeness and consideration. Bow slightly
            when greeting people, and remove shoes when entering homes,
            traditional ryokans, and some restaurants. Avoid eating while
            walking or talking loudly on public transportation. Tipping is not
            customary and can even cause confusion. When using chopsticks, never
            stick them vertically into rice (this resembles a funeral ritual)
            and don't pass food directly from chopsticks to chopsticks. Learn
            basic phrases like "<strong>Arigatou gozaimasu</strong>" (thank you)
            and "<strong>Sumimasen</strong>" (excuse me/sorry) - they'll be
            appreciated.

        <h2>Is Tokyo Worth Visiting?</h2>
        <p>
          Tokyo is absolutely worth visiting for its unique blend of ultramodern
          and traditional experiences. Few cities in the world offer such a
          fascinating contrast between cutting-edge technology and ancient
          traditions, all functioning in perfect harmony. The city's exceptional
          food scene, efficient infrastructure, distinctive neighborhoods, and
          the politeness of its people create an environment that's both
          exciting and comfortable for visitors. While Tokyo can be overwhelming
          at first due to its size and complexity, the rewards of exploring this
          dynamic metropolis are immense. Whether you're interested in
          technology, traditional culture, food, shopping, or simply
          experiencing one of the world's most unique urban environments, Tokyo
          delivers an unforgettable experience that justifies its reputation as
          one of the world's greatest cities.
